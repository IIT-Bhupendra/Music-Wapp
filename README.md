# Mint Music

Welcome to the Mint Music Player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This music player is similar to the popular Groove music player and allows you to play music from a selection of 15 songs. The user interface is beautiful and easy to use, making it a pleasure to listen to your favorite tunes.

To get started, simply select a song from the list and click the play button. You can also use the pause and progress bar to seek to a specific point in the song.

I hope you enjoy using my music player and discovering new music! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
